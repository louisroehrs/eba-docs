The list component can be particularly useful for questions that produce large collections of data. A short in-line description of each individual data item can be shown along with a link to view, in turn, a detailed summary of the particular item. Our weather agent provides a good example of this. Ask Watson "show me weather alerts in 94404". Each alert is displayed as a list item which contains a brief description of the alert along with its geo-location. If you are interested in a particular alert, simply click the link to view an alert summary. You will note that clicking the link actually generated a new question within our conversation.
