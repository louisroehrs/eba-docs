# Programming EBA

{{$site.themeConfig.product.name}} consists of a reasoning engine and a set of domain agents. Agents can be programmed and directly executed using the lab. 

As tempting as it is to dive in head first into the development environment right away, we have found that it really helps to understand the new programming paradigm that is EBA.  Please read this article [Best Practices for Working with Natural Language Understanding](../articles/NLUBestPractices.md) to better orient yourself to the ways of semantic programming.

Next, we invite you to familiarize yourself with the [components](../reference/Reference.md) necessary for building an agent, as well as with the [development lab](../lab/Overview.md) that is used to create them. Please go through our [getting started tutorial](../getting-started/GettingStarted.md) to get a strong understanding of the programming paradigm for agent, and do check out our [samples](../samples/Samples.md) to help you get started. For integration with your product take a look at [headless](../integration/Headless.md) and [web](../integration/Web.md) integration options.

The following articles will help you in your journey for working with {{$site.themeConfig.product.name}} and can be found in the Articles tab in the left-hand navigation.
