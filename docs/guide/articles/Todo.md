* Bring in the rest of the IDE documentation
  * Endpoints -- Done
* Bring in the integration parts. -- Done
* Bring in the rest.
* What about
  * Features
  * Release Notes
  * Samples

* Findings: There is lots of good documentation here that we have surfaced that was quite unfindable before.  One can now get a sense of the scope of EBA and what is need to learn how to build efficient and effective agents.
* Test all links
* Review all documentation with product
* Canonicalize labels for the lab, the paradigm, the agents.
* Update the docs to reflect these labels
* Recommend changes to EBA to reflect the same.
* Where would figures help explain?

Now that we have this documentation, test with others.
From the results, decide and take the next steps.
What additional do we automate?
What do we simplify?
